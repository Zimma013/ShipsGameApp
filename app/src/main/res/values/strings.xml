    <string name="gameRules">All players have two 10x10 fields boards.\n
            On one board, player randomly draws positions of his own ships, which will be later guessed by his opponent.\n
            The other board is to mark hit enemy ships and shots that had been made.\n\n
            Ships are set on board horizontally or vertically so they do not touch other with side or corner.\n
            Ships differ in size, players have to their disposal one four fields sized ship, two three fields sized ships, three two fields sized ships and four one field sized ships.\n\n
            To hit an opponent\'s ship, player needs to guess its location.\n
            Shots are made alternately by clicking on the opponent\'s field (e.g. B5).\n\n
            In case of a hit, player continues his turn until he misses.\n
            The ship has sunk when all its fields are found (got hit).\n\n
            First one to sink all enemy ships is the winner.</string>
